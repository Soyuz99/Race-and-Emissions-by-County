## Race-and-Emissions-by-County
# What does this dataset provide?
This data sets provides a subset of data that compares the amount of emissions per county and the racial demographics per county. The data was sourceed from 2 larger datasets, one from the EPA and another from the United States Census.
# Why is this data useful?
This data can be used to identify the relative trends between emissions and racial demographics. It can also be used to find the specific demographics and emissions in a single county as well as identifying general trends within the data. It may aslo be used for policymakers to identify where environmental racism is occuring as well as evidence that environmental racism does occur. It may also be used to supplement the understanding of the impacts of environmental racism. This data set is also quite large, so if you are looking to target a specic region or state, it may also be used for that. 
# Where do I start?
I encourage all users to start by downloading the two raw data files as you will need them to manipulate the data and create the subset. To veiw the exact process I used to attain my subset of data, you can view "Cade_3.1.ipynb" file to veiw the step-by-step process I used to attain my data. The data aggregation was done in python and utlized pandas, bot of which you will need. Personally, I used Google Colabs to run my code and manipulat my data, but any python based IDE should work.
